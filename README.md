# Easy Character creation for an RPG with AngularJS

### I created this site to test some basic interesting features of AngularJS.

Used technologies: AngularJS, jQuery, Bootstrap.

Please note that 
* the create button does not save the character here, but reroll the attributes,
* there is no validation for the name filed, and
* there is no styling yet.
